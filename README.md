# jira-timesheet-generator
Application to fetch JIRA work time log and display in a spreadsheet

We all know that JIRA has a timesheet plugin, which is no longer free since May, 2016. To simply save the cost, I developed this tool to visualize the worklog in Excel.

There are two parts:
1. The JAR file to extract the data from JIRA
2. The Excel Macro file to load the raw data and populate pivot table for any purpose, by all means.
